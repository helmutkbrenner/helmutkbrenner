- 👋 Hi, I’m @helmutkbrenner
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and cooking, I guess those two things tend to go together...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C and Python through CS50
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything; at this point if you are asking for my help, you must be desperate.
- 📫 How to reach me email or DM is fine.
